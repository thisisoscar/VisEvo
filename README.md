# VisEvo

An evolution simulation that has graphics. There are pixels which move in a random direction each frame. The amount that they move is based on their speed. If they eat food, their health goes up to max and another one spawns with a slightly different colour and speed, they are the only 2 variables that get mutated. Each frame, their health goes down by speed, so the faster they are the quicker they'll die. When an animal dies, it turns into a food pellet
